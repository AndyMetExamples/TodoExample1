# TodoExample1
An time limited example of a Angular front end with a .net 5 backend.

## Dev comments
Unforuntatley my previous experience was with AngularJS, so it took me a while getting to grips with the Angular (2+) ways of working. The result is not complete, but is an reasonable effort within the 2 hour time. I initially dabbled with creating separate projects for backendApi, models/data, and front end UI, but For expediancy, the front and back end are in the combined app.

The 'working' solution is an adaption of the boilerplate code from a ASP.NET core web app with Anuglar, created using the Rider IDE from JetBrains.

## Requirements
1. As a user, I want to view a list of tasks on a to-do list.  => __done__
2. As a user, I want to add new tasks to the to-do list.  => __incomplete__
3. As a user, I want to marka specific task tasks as complete.  => __incomplete__
4. As a user, I want to marka remove specific tasks from the to-do list.  => __incomplete__
